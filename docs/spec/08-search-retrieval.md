# Search & Retrieval

## Purpose
Define query types, ranking model, tie-break rules, indexes, and explanation payloads.

## Source material
- [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) Search and Retrieval

## Decisions Required
- Query types required as first-class.
- Dataset scale targets (12 months).
- Local embedding constraints (CPU/GPU, model size).
- Offline-first requirements (semantic search optional or required).
- Deterministic ranking formula and tie-break keys.
- Query response schema and explanation fields.

## Decisions (to fill)
- Query types:
- Dataset scale targets:
- Embedding constraints:
- Offline-first policy:
- Ranking formula and tie-break:
- Query response schema:

## Resolved
- None yet.
