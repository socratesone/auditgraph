# Spec Blueprint: Roadmap and Milestones

## Intent (read first)
This document defines what the actual specification must include. It is not the specification itself.
The spec produced from this blueprint must be implementable in code and validated by tests.

## Goal
Produce a concrete, testable roadmap spec that defines phases, deliverables,
and exit criteria.

## Source material
- [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) Milestones / Phased Plan

## Required decisions the spec must make
- Phase definitions and required deliverables.
- Exit criteria and validation steps per phase.
- Dependencies and sequencing rules.

## Required spec sections and outputs
The spec MUST include the following, with concrete requirements and examples:

1) Phase list with deliverables.
2) Exit criteria with measurable checks.
3) Dependencies between phases.

## Definition of done for the spec
- The spec defines concrete milestones and measurable exit criteria.
- The spec avoids ambiguous timeline language.

## Guardrails
- This is documentation-only. Do not treat this as runtime behavior.
