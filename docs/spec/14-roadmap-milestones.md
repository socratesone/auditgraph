# Roadmap & Milestones

## Purpose
Confirm phased plan scope, deliverables, and exit criteria.

## Source material
- [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) Milestones / Phased Plan

## Decisions Required
- Phase definitions and deliverables.
- Exit criteria per phase.
- Dependencies and sequencing.

## Decisions (filled)

### Phase Definitions

- Phase 1: CLI ingestion + extraction + indexing MVP
- Phase 2: Linking + explainability + deterministic search
- Phase 3: Automation jobs + exports
- Phase 4: Optional semantic search and UI experiments

### Exit Criteria

- Phase 1: Ingest, extract, index, and query commands verified with deterministic outputs
- Phase 2: Deterministic links with explainability and stable traversal
- Phase 3: Daily digest and report automation available
- Phase 4: Optional semantic search documented and reproducible

### Dependencies

- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 ingestion and indexing
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 link outputs
- Phase 4 depends on stable indexing and determinism gates

## Resolved

- Phases, exit criteria, and dependencies defined

## Resolved
- None yet.
