# Data Sources & Ingestion Policy

## Purpose
Define day-1 formats, code languages, structured sources, capture channels, and normalization rules.

## Source material
- [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) B) Data Sources and Formats
- [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) Solution Space: Ingestion

## Decisions Required
- Mandatory day-1 sources (Markdown, org-mode, plain text, Git repos, PDFs, DOCX, HTML, email exports, issue trackers).
- PDF reality (born-digital vs scanned; OCR policy).
- Required code languages and AST depth.
- Structured sources to ingest (OpenAPI, Terraform, CI configs, JSON/YAML manifests).
- Capture channels (directory watch, Git-based, editor plugin, manual import).
- Normalization rules (canonical frontmatter schemas vs best-effort extraction).

## Decisions (to fill)
- Day-1 sources:
- PDF handling policy:
- Code languages and AST depth:
- Structured sources:
- Capture channels:
- Normalization rules:

## Resolved
- None yet.
