# Quickstart: Interfaces and UX

## Goal

Use this spec to understand the CLI command surface, output formats, and editor integration scope.

## Steps

1. Review [specs/009-interfaces-ux/spec.md](specs/009-interfaces-ux/spec.md) for command requirements and output expectations.
2. Read [specs/009-interfaces-ux/data-model.md](specs/009-interfaces-ux/data-model.md) for command and output entities.
3. Use [specs/009-interfaces-ux/contracts/interfaces-ux.openapi.yaml](specs/009-interfaces-ux/contracts/interfaces-ux.openapi.yaml) to align per-command output fields.
4. Confirm editor integration depth in the spec.

## Success Check

- Required CLI commands are documented.
- JSON output payload fields (including error schema) are documented.
