# Quickstart

## Knowledge model defaults

- Entities and claims are canonical types.
- Notes, tasks, decisions, and events are stored as first-class node types.
- Contradictions are preserved with explicit flags.
- Confidence is rule-based only.
- Type namespaces are required for extensions.

## Example canonical types

- ag:entity
- ag:note
- ag:task
- ag:decision
- ag:event
