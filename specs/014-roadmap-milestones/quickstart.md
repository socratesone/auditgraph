This quickstart describes how to use the roadmap specification.

## 1) Review phase deliverables

Confirm each phase lists commands or artifacts that can be validated.

## 2) Validate exit criteria

Check that each exit criterion maps to a measurable validation step.

## 3) Confirm dependencies

Ensure phase dependencies are sequential from Phase 0 through Phase 6.
