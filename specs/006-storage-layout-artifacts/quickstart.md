# Quickstart: Storage Layout and Artifacts

## Goal

Use this spec to understand where artifacts live, how they are named, and what fields they contain.

## Steps

1. Review [specs/006-storage-layout-artifacts/spec.md](specs/006-storage-layout-artifacts/spec.md) for layout and schema requirements.
2. Read [specs/006-storage-layout-artifacts/data-model.md](specs/006-storage-layout-artifacts/data-model.md) for entity definitions and validation rules.
3. Use [specs/006-storage-layout-artifacts/contracts/storage-artifacts.openapi.yaml](specs/006-storage-layout-artifacts/contracts/storage-artifacts.openapi.yaml) to align schema fields with API consumers.
4. Confirm stable ID and sharding rules in the spec.

## Success Check

- Each artifact type has a documented canonical path and naming convention.
- Artifact schemas include required fields and version identifiers.
